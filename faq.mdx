## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to optimize your documentation workflow.

### Organize Content Effectively

Group pages into folders by project phase: planning, development, deployment.

| Practice | Benefit | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Use H2 for main sections | Improves navigation | `## Getting Started` |
| Add frontmatter to every page | Enables SEO and metadata | `title: My Page` |
| Limit pages to `{1500}` words | Enhances readability | Split long guides |

### Embed Documentation Snippets

Share specific sections using our embed API.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  const embedUrl = 'https://docs.dhananjayyadav.com/embed/page#section';
  fetch(embedUrl)
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(html => document.getElementById('embed').innerHTML = html);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests
  embed_url = 'https://docs.dhananjayyadav.com/embed/page#section'
  response = requests.get(embed_url)
  print(response.text)
  ```
