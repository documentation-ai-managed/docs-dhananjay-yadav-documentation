## Document Hierarchy

Documents form a tree-like structure starting from the project root. You create pages, subpages, and folders to reflect your content logic. This hierarchy appears in the sidebar navigation.

    A[Project Root] --> B[Docs]
    B --> C[Getting Started]
    B --> D[API Reference]
    C --> E[Installation]
    C --> F[Configuration]
    D --> G[Endpoints]
```

Use frontmatter in MDX files to define metadata:

<CodeGroup tabs="MDX,YAML">
  ```mdx

title: Installation Guide
description: Step-by-step setup instructions
tags: ["guide", "beginner"]
---
## Quick Start
Install via npm.
  ```
  ```yaml
title: API Endpoint
description: Handles user authentication
version: "1.0"
path: "/auth/login"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Nest pages up to five levels deep for optimal performance. Use slugs like `concepts/hierarchy` for SEO-friendly URLs.
</Callout>

## Version Control Basics

Version control lets you branch, merge, and revert changes. Integrate with Git providers to automate publishes. Create branches for features like `docs-v2.0`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Branching" icon="git-branch">
    Branch from main for new docs:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/new-guide
    git push origin feature/new-guide
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Merging" icon="git-merge">
    Merge after review:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature/new-guide
    git push origin main
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

| Action | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Create branch | `git checkout -b <name>` | Isolate changes |
| Merge | `git merge <branch>` | Integrate updates |
| Revert | `git revert <commit>` | Undo safely |
